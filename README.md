# Neural Networks - AI Programming with Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building and training a neural network to classify different species of flowers. It leverages the power of PyTorch, torchvision, and other Python libraries, employing techniques such as transfer learning and data augmentation.

### Key Features
- Data augmentation and preprocessing using torchvision transforms.
- Implementation of a pretrained VGG16 model with frozen parameters.
- Custom feedforward classifier for flower species identification.
- Training and validation loss and accuracy monitoring.
- Functionality for saving and loading model checkpoints.
- Command line applications for training models and predicting image classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- Matplotlib
- JSON (for class name mapping)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the required packages.
```
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/neural-networks-ai-python.git
cd neural-networks-ai-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training the Model
To train the model, run:
```
python train.py --data_dir [path_to_data] --arch "vgg16" --learning_rate 0.01 --hidden_units 512 --epochs 20
```

### Predicting Image Classes
To predict image classes, run:
```
python predict.py --input [path_to_image] --checkpoint [path_to_checkpoint] --top_k 5
```

## Project Structure
- `train.py`: Script to train the network.
- `predict.py`: Script for predicting image classes.
- `Development Notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook detailing the model building process.
